//write a blog about objct and array and its internal representaion in java script//

OBJECT:
 
 //key value pair to store  data.
 //object-{}
 //data accessed by key name.
   
   eg..
   let obj={name:raja,height:5.5};
    
    // if accessed height
    to do..
    obj.('height')

 ARRAYS:

 2)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?



HTTP 1.1:
   // HTTP was created in 1997.
   // TCP connection required for each request and response.
   // its works on the textual format.
   // It does not allows the next request to be sent until the previous response complete.
   // It takes more time to complete the all the request to render the content in browser.
   // It sends the request in text format.
   // It does not send the multiple requests at a time.
   //it compresses data by itself

HTTP 2:
   // HTTP2 was created in 2015.
   //it uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
   //it is work on the binary protocol.
   // It reduces the execution time.
   // All the requests and responses are in binary format.
   // It encodes the request and response into smaller units.
   // It supports multiplexing.
   // Better Performance compared to HTTP1.
   // It allows multiple request and response at a time in parallel using single TCP connection.
